# Automation test with Gauge and Selenium

<<<<<<< HEAD
Gauge is a light-weight open source test automation tool with the ability to author test cases in the business language.  It is powerful, easy-to-use, supporting multiple languages including  Java, C#, Python, Ruby, and Javascript. Gauge gives you a business layer on top of your test scripts to make them more readable and more understandable. For example, if you create a test using Java, Gauge will be the business layer on top of it. Your test requirements can then be captured in a way that allows everyone on your team, including non-technical peple that don’t know Java can understand what the test is doing.

Here we will combine Gauge with Selenium WebDriver - a web automation framework that allows you to execute your tests against different browsers including Chrome, Firefox, IE. WebDriver enables you to use a programming language in creating your test scripts.
